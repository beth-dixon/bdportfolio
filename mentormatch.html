        <p>
            An alpha stage project looking at providing information to users on the next steps of an application. Handed over an existing tool that was created by another team which we worked on to iterate and make it suitable for users.  
        </p>

    <div class="problem">
     <h2 class="headers" style="padding-top: 20px">The problem</h2>
        <p>
           During an application process people want to know more information about the next steps of their application and are call centers are responding to an increase of queries.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many people have similar questions about their applications and contact the call centres. People are often worried about the potential issues that could arise with their application, and uncertainty and delay causes more problems and fear.
        </p>

        <p> 
            It is our role to create something that will help reduce the fear and to reassure users about the next steps of their application in an effective way.

    <div class="challenge">
     <h2  class="headers" style="padding-top: 20px">Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            My challenge was to take the existing prototype that was built on a different platform and use existing patterns and components to make it fit with GOV.UK design standards. Another challenge was to communicate information in a clear way where final policy and publications had not been yet decided. 
        </p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="process">
     <h2 class="headers" style="padding-top: 20px">Design Process</h2>
        <p>
        
        I worked with a content designer to review the existing information that was handed over by the team. Our first goal was to understand the complex spreadsheet they had provided and understand the content and the user journeys.
        </p>
        
        <P>
            We wanted to map out the key user journeys and outcomes that users would receive. We wanted to understand the information and provide them with the best detailed information that would prevent them from ringing to ask more information. 
        </P>
        
        <p>
            Using the reviewed content, we mapped out each journey and built a prototype which asked the users a series of questions. Depending on the response, a specific outcome would inform the user of the next steps to take in their application process.
            
        </p>
        
        <p> 
        My role was to build a prototype that we could test and iterate. Once we finalised the architecture and content, I used the GOV.UK prototyping kit to build a prototype, adhering to the government design standards. We initially sketched out ways we could present the information, but needed interactivity from the user so decided to use radio buttons to walkthrough the questions. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The complexity of the user journeys meant it was quite confusing when displaying the correct information on the webpage. I explored different ways of prototyping, including using static pages, but decided a dynamic prototype would would be more beneficial overall.
        </p>

    <div class="outcome">
     <h2 class="headers" style="padding-top: 20px">Outcome</h2>
        
        <p>
            Explaining the purpose of the tool to users was difficult and we realised in research that we weren’t providing the right information. The content was ambiguous and people still weren’t understanding what their final outcome and next steps of the process were. The tool was handed over to another team who continued to work on iterating the tool.

        <p>
       Worked iteratively by creating 3 versions of a prototype

       Completed a content and heuristic review of the existing prototype and redesigned it fitting to government design standards.

        Planned and mapped out different user journeys that covered different roles
